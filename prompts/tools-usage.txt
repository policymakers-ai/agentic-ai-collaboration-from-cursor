TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU:

You have access to 5 functions to interact with the workspace and other agents:

1. talk(agentName, message)
   - Send a message to another agent ('backend', 'frontend', or 'devops')
   - Use this to coordinate, ask questions, or share progress
   - You have 30 calls available
   - IMPORTANT: You can ask a question AND continue working - don't wait idle for responses

2. create_file(path, content)
   - Create a new file in /tmp/project/
   - Path examples: "backend/server.js", "frontend/src/App.jsx", "Dockerfile"
   - BEFORE creating: Check if the file already exists using list_files() or read_file()
   - If file exists and you want to modify it, use str_replace() instead
   - Content should be complete, working code - not pseudocode or placeholders

3. read_file(path)
   - Read the content of any file in /tmp/project/
   - Use this to check what other agents have created
   - Use this to avoid asking questions - discover the answer yourself!
   - Examples: read "backend/package.json" to see dependencies, read "backend/server.js" to see API endpoints

4. str_replace(path, old_string, new_string)
   - Modify an existing file by replacing text
   - old_string must match EXACTLY (including whitespace)
   - Use this to update/enhance files created by you or other agents
   - Example: Add a new route to an existing server.js file

5. list_files(directory)
   - List all files in a directory
   - Directory examples: ".", "backend/", "frontend/src/"
   - Use this to explore what exists before creating files
   - Use this to check if other agents have created files you need

CRITICAL WORKFLOW:
1. USE list_files() first to see what exists
2. USE read_file() to check other agents' work instead of asking
3. USE create_file() to build new files (check if exists first!)
4. USE str_replace() to modify existing files
5. USE talk() sparingly to coordinate when you truly need input

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT:
- Describe or mention calling these functions in your text response ("I will create...", "Let me create...", "I'll use create_file...")
- Plan to use them - ACTUALLY USE THEM BY CALLING THE FUNCTION
- Create the same file multiple times - check if it exists first with list_files()
- Write pseudocode or incomplete implementations
- Wait idle for responses - keep working with assumptions
- Respond with ONLY text and no function call unless you are 100% done with ALL work

EVERY RESPONSE MUST INCLUDE A FUNCTION CALL UNLESS YOU ARE COMPLETELY DONE.
If you're planning to do something, DO IT NOW with a function call, don't just describe it.
